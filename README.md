### Project Description: 
 
Team C4M proposes a task management system to help teams of people coordinate their efforts when working together on a group project. Users can sign up for accounts, create new teams and join existing teams. A team can create projects which are broken down into discrete tasks or objectives. These tasks and objects will be assigned to members of the team to work on. Once a task has been completed, the member responsible for it can mark it as such on the system for the other members to see.
 
Our system will track deadlines and notify members of upcoming due dates. Our system will also have messaging and document exchange features for team members to communicate with each other and transfer information to other members.

- Not able to display error message on its box 

#### Overcome
- Since it is on client render part,use JavaScript to keep track on which value is selected before submission. 
- Set user’s id and project’s id [Both are foreign key] as primary key and unique, then use INSERT …. DUPLICATE UPDATE ON query.

#### What's Next

#### Learning Curve
- Learning curve for this project was medium

#### Overcome
- SQL datetime data and PHP datatime data type are not entirely compatible and so techniques were researched to convert SQL datetime data into a form that is recognized by PHP
- SQL queries were designed to efficiently obtain the needed data and filter out data that is not required, thereby reducing the data processing workload required in PHP
- Research into HTML and Bootstrap progress bar element was educational

#### What's Next
- Styling improvements 
- Expand the functionality of the Notification and Upcoming Due Dates features to display more useful information to the user

### MIHOKO SCHICK'S CONTRIBUTION

#### Features

- Sign up and Login (views/login.php, views/signup.php/ Model/Authentication.php)
- Contact Us Page (views/contactus.php, /Model/Contact.php)

#### Description
- Sign up: User input name (first and last name), email address and password, and  confirm password, validate inputs.Password field encrypts using “password_hash”. If there are no validation errors, these information will be stored in the database. Once the user creates the account, automatically login and move to the task management page. Use sessions. 
- Login: User input email address and password, and validate the inputs. If email address and password match to the data stored in the database, the user can login and move to the task management page. Use session, so that the user does not need to login again if the user closes the browser and comes back to the dashboard again.
- Contact Us page form contains inputs for the name, email, phone number, dropdown for inquiry type, and text area for message. Name, email, inquiry dropdown and message area have validation and phone number field is optional. If there is no validation error, the confirmation page will display with information user inputed. If the user clicks the ''send' button, the form information will be stored in the database(contact_info_public). “Thank you message” will be displayed and the button will be disabled.
- FAQ: Main FAQ page has three categories:“Getting Started”, “Dashboard”, “Troubleshooting” . Once a user clicks a button, the page will redirect to the Search Results page. Questions and answers for the categories will be retrieved from the database.Main FAQ page and search result page have a search bar so that the user can use a search bar to look for certain questions, the system will use keywords to try to find an equivalent question in the system.
