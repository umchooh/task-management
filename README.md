### Project Description: 
 
Team C4M proposes a task management system to help teams of people coordinate their efforts when working together on a group project. Users can sign up for accounts, create new teams and join existing teams. A team can create projects which are broken down into discrete tasks or objectives. These tasks and objects will be assigned to members of the team to work on. Once a task has been completed, the member responsible for it can mark it as such on the system for the other members to see.
 
Our system will track deadlines and notify members of upcoming due dates. Our system will also have messaging and document exchange features for team members to communicate with each other and transfer information to other members.
